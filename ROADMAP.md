# PodCutter roadmap

## Now (v0.1, Windows)

- Multicam cutting engine with per-speaker and style tuning, a live preview, locks, markers, and a build-on-copy step
- Offline transcription (bundled whisper.cpp) and transcript cleanup suggestions
- Self-contained Windows installer with no admin rights, no internet, and no separately installed AI runtime

## v0.2 (added)

- **Moving cameras:** a camera-motion analyzer (block matching plus a robust global-motion fit, so people moving in frame don't count). Cuts to a dolly or operated camera only once it has settled, waits briefly or goes to the wide during moves, and can keep slow push-ins on air.
- **Follows-speaker cameras:** an operated camera that counts as a close-up of whoever is talking.

## v0.3 (added)

- **Show setups:** built-in setups for 1, 2, 3, and 4+ subjects, plus saved setups matched by track name and applied automatically. VOX-named tracks are preferred as speaker mics.
- Trash icon with confirmation for speakers, cameras, and saved setups.
- **In-panel updater:** checks GitHub releases or a shared update folder, then installs silently.

## v0.3.2 – v0.4 (added)

- Mics that share one multichannel file get one channel per speaker, decided per clip.
- Analyze and cut only between the sequence In/Out marks.
- **Recut** the existing copy in place (keeps nests) and **Undo recut** (last 5 versions).
- Cleanup flags phone and alarm interruptions, including Whisper sound tags.

## v0.5 (added)

- **Who's in the shot** for operated cameras: steady stretches grouped by appearance and named from the audio, editable thumbnails, so the follow cam is used only when it's on the person talking (and can be a reaction shot when it's on a listener).
- Cut away from any camera movement by default (slow moves on air is now opt-in).
- **Max cuts / min** cap (drops the least important cuts first) and a "Shots by reason" breakdown under the preview.
- **Minimum wide**: wide shots run at least 5 s by default.
- Cleanup follows an abandoned tangent from the cut cue to "okay, we're back", and flags pre-show and post-show chatter (v0.5.4).
- The welcome address with the show's name marks the start of the show, with one-click In/Out points (v0.5.5).

## v0.6 (added)

- **Layered cut:** the bottom camera (the wide) stays whole and enabled; only the cameras above it are razored, where they switch. About half the edits with two cameras, and recut cleans up older full cuts.

## v0.7 (added)

- **Simpler cutting style:** the main controls up front (mode, Max cuts / min, Minimum close-up, Minimum wide) and everything else under a collapsible **Advanced** section.
- **Mic confidence:** a collapsible meter per speaker under the preview (level, bleed, borderline and possibly missed speech, weak stretches), with tips.
- **The bottom camera is the wide:** a scan sets it up as the wide, and it's always kept whole. The switch moved to Advanced → Timeline.
- **Content cut warning:** after a scan, flags sections between content cuts in the wide's footage that are shorter than the minimum, under Minimum wide and on the Cleanup tab.
- **Static cameras:** a Static option per camera (works alongside Check for movement).
- **Modes:** new Rapid cutting (once cameras are marked Static, warns if anyone lacks a static close-up) and Interview; presets renamed as modes, each with a description.
- **Close-ups / wide slider:** leans the whole cut toward the speaker close-ups or the static wide (some turns play on the wide).
- **Feature slider per person** (replaces Priority): more screen time for a special guest.

## v0.8 (added)

- **Introduction:** finds the welcome, the host and everyone introduced in the transcript; the cut opens on the host's solo cam, then the wide for the introductions; lower-third name markers with editable name-tag text.
- **Reload instead of restart:** after an update, Reload PodCutter loads the new version in place; Premiere only needs restarting when the manifest changed.

- **Hidden camera tracks (v0.8.1):** Build and Recut turn on track output (the eye) for the camera tracks they cut; the scan notes hidden ones.

- **Multicam by keystrokes, trial (v0.8.2):** reads the Cut to Camera shortcuts from Premiere's .kys file and presses them on a multicam clip (Settings > Multicam by keystrokes), as a first test of cutting real multicam sequences. v0.8.3 finds the shortcuts in a redirected Documents folder, accepts a nest with Multi-Camera enabled, and logs each step.

## v0.9 (added)

- **Build as multicam (experimental):** applies the planned cut to a Multi-Camera nest by pressing Cut to Camera at each angle change (angle = the camera's original track), with progress, Stop, Resume, and a count of the pieces afterwards to check every cut landed. v0.9.1: an option to build only between the multicam sequence's In and Out marks.

## v0.10 (added)

- **In/Out followed live:** waveforms and camera movement are analyzed for the whole sequence once; moving the In/Out marks in Premiere re-plans the preview and cut straight away.
- **Build as multicam skips uncovered stretches** (no multicam footage at the ends or in a gap) instead of refusing.

## v0.11 (added)

- **Reads inside multicam nests:** a nested/multicam sequence's angles become camera tracks mapped onto the timeline, so movement and framing analysis still see the dolly; one click moves a saved setup onto the angles.
- **Camera 2 shots labelled Rose** after any build (option, on by default).

## v0.12 (added)

- **No more silent "steady":** a moving camera with no footage to measure is flagged (red warning, builds refuse) instead of being treated as steady; a sequence whose cameras moved into a nest switches to the nest's angles at Scan.
- **Mark camera moves:** timeline markers over every detected move (red big, orange slow).

## v0.13 (added)

- **The wide is the safety:** after a move, back to the dolly only if it then stays steady (Come back after, 3 s); banter stays wide; reactions on the dolly only when it's steady throughout; cuts to the wide never wait (late cut timing doesn't apply to them).
- **Intro:** the wide holds at least 15 s for the name cards (adjustable); every build marks the welcome.

## v0.14 (added)

- **Recut multicam / Undo multicam cut:** every build retypes all pieces in its range (so leftover edit points can't keep stale angles); the last 5 builds per sequence are kept, and Undo re-applies the previous one (or the wide everywhere after a first build). Rose labels follow.

## v0.15 (added)

- **Reactions to the wide:** a reaction from someone without a usable close-up cuts to the wide instead of being skipped, and two or more listeners reacting together always cut to the wide.
- **Undo and Recut fix:** cuts land on exact frames, so they hit the edit points left by earlier builds instead of leaving one-frame slivers. A click while busy now says so.

## v0.16 (added)

- **Label colour by keystroke:** pick any of the 16 label colours for camera 2 shots. A multicam build selects those pieces and presses your Edit > Label shortcut, since scripts often can't set the colour.
- **Updates:** checks when the panel opens and every 2 hours.
- **Double-click a slider** to reset it to its default.
- **Content cuts already in the timeline are covered:** the camera changes exactly on the cut (off the wide to the solo of whoever speaks next, off a solo to the wide), not just for sections ticked on the Cleanup tab.
- **Stay on the speaker:** a bump on several mics at the same instant is not a reaction; no reaction or cutaway just before the next turn (Hold before next turn).
- **Dolly stays on the last person until it moves** (when there is no Who's in the shot reading), and a follow-cam shot that runs across a change of speaker is checked against whoever has the floor at each moment.
- **Picture names checked by voice:** a long steady dolly stretch named after someone silent while another person talks is treated as on the talker. A follow-cam shot spanning several speakers is split per speaker, so monologue cutaways measure one person's turn. A brief aside over someone who carries on isn't crosstalk.

## v0.18.1 (added)

- **Multicams whose angles are per-camera nests** (`<ep>_mc` of `<ep>_a_cam` / `<ep>_b_cam`, as PodGrip assembles them) are read down to the camera files. Before, Scan found no angles, so both cameras sat on V1, Build as multicam wasn't offered, and the camera 2 labels didn't apply.
- **"Recut" only when there's something to recut.**
  - "Recut multicam" was offered on a newly opened sequence after a build on another one; it now only shows for a sequence that has been built.
  - A copy deleted from the project is forgotten, so Recut isn't offered for it.

## v0.18 (added)

- **PodDirector is now PodCutter.** The panel, menu item, installer, update packages and Documents folder all use the new name.
  - The first time it opens, the panel copies your presets, setups, transcripts and exports from `Documents\PodDirector` to `Documents\PodCutter`. The old folder is left as it was.
  - Installing (or updating) removes the old PodDirector panel folder.
  - Updating from an installed PodDirector works as usual: each release also carries the package under its old name. That update needs a Premiere restart.
  - Not renamed, so nothing is lost: the extension ID, the panel's saved settings, `[PD]` marker names (Clear markers still finds old ones) and earlier "… - PodDirector" sequence copies, which Recut still finds by their ID.
- **Wide + dolly handoffs** retuned with the dolly footage of 36 past episodes (tools/analyze_past.js, mapped through each edit's multicam to the camera files): wides 9 s minimum (was 12), solo 4.5 s in, back to the dolly 1.5 s after a move. With motion and framing it matches David's camera choice 79% of the time, at 48% wide (David 44%), cutting to the solo 4.6 s into a turn (David 4.6 s), and shows the dolly mid-move 0.1% of the solo time (David 0.1%; 1.7% without motion readings).

## v0.17 (added)

- **Wide + dolly handoffs** mode, learned by lining up 35 finished Classical et cetera edits (tools/prproj.js) with the mic audio. Wide around each change of speaker (from 1.5 s before), the new speaker's solo 5 s in, short turns on the wide, long shots. On audio-only replays it matches David's camera choice 78% of the time (Roundtable: 47%). New settings: Solo after, Wide before handoff.

## v0.16.1 (added)

- A content cut is covered even when the covering camera moves a few seconds later: the cover is cut short before the move (it used to be dropped, leaving the jump).
- The analysis export lists the content cuts found in the timeline.
- **tools/prproj.js:** reads finished edits straight from Premiere project files (no Premiere): every sequence, track and piece, label colours, sources, and the camera angle of each multicam piece. Run over a folder of episodes to learn from past edits. The wide is the angle shot on the 24-70 (Sony sidecar lens); --aperture settles ties by f-number (exiftool, cached).

## Next candidates

- **Jump-cut / silence removal** (AutoPod's "Jump Cut Editor"): ripple-delete silences on every track, using the existing mic analysis
- **Apply accepted cleanup cuts**: optional ripple delete of the accepted transcript ranges on the copy, not only markers
- **Multicam-source output**: switch angles inside a Premiere multicam source sequence instead of enabling tracks
- **Social reframe/export**: vertical and square versions (AutoPod's "Social Media Exporter")
- **Speaker labels in the transcript**: per-mic transcription for exact attribution when bleed is heavy
- **Signed ZXP package**, so `PlayerDebugMode` is not needed
- **UXP migration**: Adobe plans to disable CEP by default in Premiere around Dec 2028
- **Claude / MCP hook**: let Claude call `plan` and `cleanup` directly and push tuned configs into the panel

## Future platforms (logged by request, not started)

- **macOS build**: bundle darwin ffmpeg and whisper.cpp, plus a `.pkg` or shell installer. The engine and panel code are already cross-platform.
- **Linux build** for Premiere-style editors on Linux (the "FilmCraft"/ArtCraft-type clones). This needs a host adapter for that editor's scripting API, or an EDL/FCPXML exporter. The cutting and transcript engines are host-independent pure JavaScript.
